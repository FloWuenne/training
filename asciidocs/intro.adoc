= Get started with Nextflow

== Basic concepts

Nextflow is workflow orchestration engine and a programming domain specific language (DSL)
that eases the writing of data-intensive computational pipelines.

It is designed around the idea that the Linux platform is the _lingua franca_ of data science.
Linux provides many simple but powerful command-line and scripting tools that, when chained together,
facilitate complex data manipulations.

Nextflow extends this approach, adding the ability to define complex program interactions and a
high-level parallel computational environment based on the dataflow programming model. Nextflow
core features are:

* enable workflows portability & reproducibility
* simplify parallelization and large scale deployment
* easily integrate existing tools, systems & industry standards

=== Processes and channels

In practice a Nextflow pipeline script is made by joining together different processes.
Each process can be written in any scripting language that can be executed by the Linux platform
(Bash, Perl, Ruby, Python, etc.).

Processes are executed independently and are isolated from each other, i.e. they do not share a common
(writable) state. The only way they can communicate is via asynchronous FIFO queues, called
_channels_ in Nextflow.

Any process can define one or more channels as input and output. The interaction between these processes,
and ultimately the pipeline execution flow itself, is implicitly defined by these input and output declarations.

=== Execution abstraction

While a process defines _what_ command or script has to be executed, the executor determines
how that script is actually run in the target system.

If not otherwise specified, processes are executed on the local computer. The local executor
is very useful for pipeline development and testing purposes, but for real world computational
pipelines an HPC or cloud platform is often required.

In other words, Nextflow provides an abstraction between the pipeline's functional logic and
the underlying execution system. Thus it is possible to write a pipeline once and to seamlessly
run it on your computer, a grid platform, or the cloud, without modifying it, by simply defining
the target execution platform in the configuration file.

It provides out-of-the-box support for major batch schedulers and cloud platforms:

* Grid engine (Open/Sun/Univa/Altair)
* IBM Platform LSF
* Linux SLURM
* PBS Works
* Torque
* Moab
* Amazon Batch
* Azure Batch
* Google Life Sciences
* Kubernetes

=== Scripting language

Nextflow implements declarative domain specific language (DSL; version 2) simplifies the writing 
of complex data analysis workflows as an extension of a general purpose programming language.

This approach makes Nextflow very flexible, because it allows in the same
computing environment the benefits of concise DSL allowing the handling of
recurrent use cases with ease *and* the flexibility and power of a general purpose
programming language to handle corner cases, which may be difficult to implement using
a declarative approach.

In practical terms Nextflow scripting is an extension of the https://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy programming language],
which in turn is a super-set of the Java programming language. Groovy can be considered as Python for Java in that
is simplifies the writing of code and is more approachable.



== Your first script

Copy the following example into your favourite text editor and save it
to a file named `hello.nf` :

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

nextflow.enable.dsl=2

process splitLetters {

    input:
    val x 

    output:
    file 'chunk_*' 

    """
    printf '$x' | split -b 6 - chunk_
    """
}

process convertToUpper {

    input:
    file y

    output:
    stdout 

    """
    cat $y | tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'
    """
}

params.greeting  = 'Hello world!'
greeting_ch = Channel.from(params.greeting)

workflow {

    letters_ch = splitLetters(greeting_ch)
    uppercase_ch = convertToUpper( letters_ch.flatten() )
    uppercase_ch.view{ it.trim() }

}
----

This script first defines two processes. The first splits a string into files
containing chunks of 6 characters. The second accepts the files and transforms their 
contents to uppercase letters. Next we specify a parameter called "greeting", 
which we put into a channel "greeting_ch" to be used with the executed workflow. 

In the workflow execution section, first the greeting_ch is split by the 
splitLetters process putting the output in the letters_ch (letters channel). Next, 
the letter_ch is processed with the convertToUpper process. The resulting strings 
are emitted to the standard output in the uppercase_ch which is printed by the 
`view` operator. 


Execute the script by entering the following command in your terminal:

[source,cmd]
----
nextflow run hello.nf
----

It will output something similar to the text shown below:

[source,cmd]
----
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.10.0
Launching `hello.nf` [marvelous_plateau] - revision: 63f8ad7155
[warm up] executor > local
executor >  local (3)
[19/c2f873] process > splitLetters   [100%] 1 of 1 ✔
[05/5ff9f6] process > convertToUpper [100%] 2 of 2 ✔
HELLO
WORLD!
----

You can see that the first process is executed once, and the second
twice. Finally the result string is printed.

It's worth noting that the process `convertToUpper` is executed in
parallel, so there's no guarantee that the instance processing the first
split (the chunk Hello) will be executed before before the one
processing the second split (the chunk world!).

Thus, it is perfectly possible that you will get the final result
printed out in a different order:

....
WORLD!
HELLO
....

TIP: The hexadecimal numbers, like `22/7548fa`, identify the unique process
execution. These numbers are also the prefix of the directories where each
process is executed. You can inspect the files produced by them changing to the directory
`$PWD/work` and using these numbers to find the process-specific
execution path.

== Modify and resume

Nextflow keeps track of all the processes executed in your pipeline. If
you modify some parts of your script, only the processes that are
actually changed will be re-executed. The execution of the processes
that are not changed will be skipped and the cached result used instead.

This helps a lot when testing or modifying part of your pipeline without
having to re-execute it from scratch.

For the sake of this tutorial, modify the `convertToUpper` process in
the previous example, replacing the process script with the string
`rev $y`, so that the process looks like this:

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
process convertToUpper {

    input:
    file y

    output:
    stdout 

    """
    rev $y
    """
}
----

Then save the file with the same name, and execute it by adding the
`-resume` option to the command line:

----
nextflow run hello.nf -resume
----

It will print output similar to this:

----
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.10.0
Launching `hello.nf` [naughty_tuckerman] - revision: 22eaa07be4
[warm up] executor > local
executor >  local (2)
[19/c2f873] process > splitLetters   [100%] 1 of 1, cached: 1 ✔
[a7/a410d3] process > convertToUpper [100%] 2 of 2 ✔
olleH
!dlrow
----

You will see that the execution of the process `splitLetters` is
actually skipped (the process ID is the same), and its results are
retrieved from the cache. The second process is executed as expected,
printing the reversed strings.

TIP: The pipeline results are cached by default in the directory `$PWD/work`.
Depending on your script, this folder can take of lot of disk space.
If your are sure you won't resume your pipeline execution, clean this folder periodically.


== Pipeline parameters

Pipeline parameters are simply declared by prepending to a variable name
the prefix `params`, separated by dot character. Their value can be
specified on the command line by prefixing the parameter name with a
double dash character, i.e. `--paramName`

For the sake of this tutorial, you can try to execute the previous
example specifying a different input string parameter, as shown below:

----
nextflow run hello.nf --greeting 'Bonjour le monde!'
----

The string specified on the command line will override the default value
of the parameter. The output will look like this:

----
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.10.0
Launching `hello.nf` [wise_stallman] - revision: 22eaa07be4
